# # Vectors Lab
# 
# In this notebook you will learn how to graph two dimensional (2D) vectors and certain vector computations. 
# 
# Specifically: 
# 1. Plotting a 2D vector
# 2. Multiplying a 2D vector by a scalar and plotting the results
# 3. Adding two 2D vectors together and plotting the results
# 
#   
# For this lab, we will be using the python package [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for creating vectors and computing vector operations. For the graphing aspects of the lab, we will be using python package [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html).
# 

# ## Plotting a Vector in 2D
# For this part of the lab, we will plot the vector $\vec{v}$ defined below.
#    
# $\hspace{1cm}\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$
# 
# Below is an outline that describes what is included in the Python code to plot vector $\vec{v}$.
# 1. Make both NumPy and Matlibplot python packages available using the _import_ method   
# &nbsp;  
# 2. Define vector $\vec{v}$    
# &nbsp;    
# 3. Plot vector $\vec{v}$ using Matlibplot  
#     1. Create a variable *__ax__* to reference the axes of the plot 
#     2. Plot the origin as a red dot at point 0,0 using *__ax__* and _plot_ method 
#     3. Plot vector $\vec{v}$ as a blue arrow with origin at 0,0 using *__ax__* and _arrow_ method 
#     4. Format x-axis 
#         1. Set limits using _xlim_ method
#         2. Set major tick marks using *__ax__* and *set_xticks* method
#     5. Format y-axis 
#         1. Set limits using _ylim_ method
#         2. Set major tick marks using *__ax__* and *set_yticks* method  
#     6. Create the gridlines using _grid_ method  
#     7. Display the plot using _show_ method

# Import NumPy and Matplotlib

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define vector v 
v = np.array([1,1])

# Creates axes of plot referenced 'ax'
ax = plt.axes()

# Plots red dot at origin (0,0)
ax.plot(0,0,'or')

# Plots vector v as blue arrow starting at origin 0,0
ax.arrow(0, 0, *v, color='b', linewidth=2.0, head_width=0.20, head_length=0.25)

# Sets limit for plot for x-axis

# ## Scaling a Vector using a Scalar
# For this part of the lab, we will plot the results of scaling vector $\vec{v}$ by the scalar $a$. Both scalar $a$ and vector $\vec{v}$ have been defined below.
#    
# 
# $\hspace{1cm}a = 3 $
# 
# 
# $\hspace{1cm}\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$
# 
# ### TODO: Multiply Vector by Scalar and Plot Results
# For this part of the lab you will be creating vector $\vec{av}$ and then adding to the plot as a dotted <span style="color:cyan; font-weight: bold">cyan</span> colored vector.
# 
# 
# 1. Multiply vector $\vec{v}$ by scalar $a$ in the code below (see *__TODO 1.:__*).  
# &nbsp; 
# 
# 2. Use the _ax.arrow(...)_ statement in the code below to add vector $\vec{av}$ to the plot (see **__TODO 2.:__*). Adding _linestyle = 'dotted'_ and changing _color = 'c'_ in the _ax.arrow(...)_ statement will make vector $\vec{av}$ a dotted cyan colored vector.

# ## Adding Two Vectors Together
# For this part of the lab, we will plot the result of adding vector $\vec{w}$ to vector $\vec{v}$. Both vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, have been defined below.
# 
# 
# $\hspace{1cm}\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix}$
# 
# 
# $\hspace{1cm}\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix} -2\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$
# 
# ### Plotting Two Vectors
# The code and the plot that displays vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ from origin (0,0) can be found below.

# In[3]:


# Define vector v 
v = np.array([1,1])

# Define vector w
w = np.array([-2,2])

# Plots vector v(blue arrow) and vector w(cyan arrow) with red dot at origin (0,0) 
# using Matplotlib

# Creates axes of plot referenced 'ax'
ax = plt.axes()

# Plots red dot at origin (0,0)
ax.plot(0,0,'or')

# Plots vector v as blue arrow starting at origin 0,0
ax.arrow(0, 0, *v, color='b', linewidth=2.5, head_width=0.30, head_length=0.35)

# ### Vector Addition 
# Below we display graphically, adding vector $\vec{w}$ to vector $\vec{v}$.
# 
# ### Plotting Vector Addition
# The code and plot that display adding vector $\vec{w}$ to vector $\vec{v}$ can be found below. Notice when we add vector $\vec{w}$ to vector $\vec{v}$, vector $\vec{w}$'s origin is now (1,1).  Additionally, we have added _linestyle = 'dotted'_ and changed _color = 'c'_ in the _ax.arrow(...)_ statement to make vector $\vec{w}$ a dotted cyan colored vector.

# ### TODO: Adding Two Vectors and Plotting Results
# For this part of the lab you will be creating vector $\vec{vw}$ and then adding it to the plot as a thicker width **black** colored vector.
# 
# 
# 1. Create vector $\vec{vw}$ by adding vector $\vec{w}$ to vector $\vec{v}$ in the code below (see *__TODO 1.:__*).  
# &nbsp;
